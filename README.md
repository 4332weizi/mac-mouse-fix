# Mac Mouse Fix

A simple way to make your mouse better.

### [Download](http://www.mousefix.org) | [Pre-releases](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases)

## Features

* Switch between Spaces, activate Mission Control, trigger Quick Look, or use the side buttons to navigate through pages in your browser. All of that and more. Right from your mouse.
* New Smooth Scrolling algorithm that strikes a perfect balance between fluidity and control. Allows you to change mouse scrolling direction independently of trackpad scrolling direction.
* 100% free, light on system resources, and fully open source. Plugs into System Preferences. There is no status bar item. Mouse Fix aims to be as clutter free as possible.
