# Questions

##### Why build it? There's already apps for remapping mouse buttons and smooth scrolling.
I was looking for a way to use spaces and mission control from my mouse. I found some great software like Steer Mouse or USB Overdrive, but none of them were free. So I decided to build my own solution. Working on the smooth scrolling algorithm was a lot of fun for me and I think it turned out really well.

#####Does Mouse Fix track you / have ads?
I'm committed to your privacy. Mouse Fix does not have ads and it doesn't track any information about you. I did not make Mouse Fix to make money (but you're very welcome to [buy me a milkshake] (https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ARSTVR6KFB524&source=url) if you want to! ;))
