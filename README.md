## Features

* Switch Between Spaces, activate Mission Control, Launchpad, and Quick Look, or use the side buttons to navigate through pages in your browser. All of that and more. Right from your mouse.
* New Smooth Scrolling algorithm that strikes a perfect balance between fluidity and control. Allows you to change mouse scrolling direction independently of trackpad scrolling direction.
* 100% free, light on system resources, and fully open source. 


## Questions

Why make it? There's already apps for smooth scrolling and remapping mouse buttons.

I was looking for a way to use Spaces and Mission Control from my mouse. I found some great software like Steer Mouse and USB Overdrive, but none of it was free. So I decided to build my own - 100% free - solution. I had a ton of fun creating my own scrolling algorithm, and I thinki t turned out really well.
