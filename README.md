- This branch used to be called `2.0.0`
- Most relevant changes from this branch have been moved to the `feature-remap` branch
- There are still some changes to scrolling in this which aren't reflected anywhere else.
    - Something went wrong when creating the `feature-remap` branch, which probably sees us having to manually copy paste the scroll-related changes from this branch if we want to use them somewhere else

## Features

* Switch between Spaces, activate Mission Control, trigger Quick Look, or use the side buttons to navigate through pages in your browser. All of that and more. Right from your mouse.
* Smooth Scrolling algorithm that strikes a perfect balance between fluidity and control. Allows you to change mouse scrolling direction independently of trackpad scrolling direction.
* 100% free, light on system resources, and fully open source. Plugs into System Preferences. There is no status bar item. Mouse Fix aims to be as clutter free as possible.
